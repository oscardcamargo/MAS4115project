# Optical Character Recognition of Handwritten Characters
This was my final project for the class MAS4115 - Linear Algebra for Data Science at the University of Florida. The project showcases the capabilities of k-nearest neighbors and k-means clustering for the recognition of handwritten digits. Detailed explanations and implementations of the algorithms can be found in both the .pdf document and the jupyter notebook in this repository.
